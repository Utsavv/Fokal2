              If you are a photography enthusiast, there is a good chance that you must have either gone on or heard about photo walks. Photo walk is an activity when two or more people get together with the sole agenda of clicking pictures. 
              </p>
              <p>
              There are many ways that you can be a part of a photo walk. One way is to identify a friend who has an interest in photography, decide the day and the location and just go for it! Else, you can join a club/group which organizes such walks on frequent basis. The membership of such clubs is mostly free. Then there are some photography-course providers who arrange mentored photo-walks where an expert is present to guide the way.
              </p>
              <p>
              Whichever type of photo-walks you chose to be a part of, there are 4 benefits which you can look to draw from these photography walks.

              </p>
              <br>
              <h3>1. A buddy who is equally excited about photography as you are! </h3>

                Let’s admit, clicking great pictures requires a lot of patience and work. And, while moving around with a group of people who are not as interested in photography as you are, it is neither pleasant nor easy to hold up the entire group for, well, taking pictures! However, if you go on a photo-walk with equally passionate people, the things are much easier. Every one stops for taking pictures and enjoys the process.

              <h3>2. Inspire and be inspired!</h3>
             
              <p>
                Being in the company of other passionate photographers, you get pushed out of your comfort zone. You would learn a lot of different techniques, hacks & perspectives and be encouraged to try the newly learned techniques. Meeting often with a group of like-minded people would keep you motivated.   
              </p>
              
                <br>
              <h3>3. Instant critique and opportunity to improve</h3>
           
              <p>
                After taking a few shots, you can look at each other’s pictures. You would notice that everyone looks at the same scene differently. This is true, whether you are in a mentored photo-walk or with a buddy. You can also apply in next few shots what you learnt from each other. This opportunity of repetition improves your photography skills fast.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>4. Share your work</h3>
           
              
              <p>
                Post the walk, after you are through with the post-processing, each of the group members can share their work. It is interesting to see how each outcome looks so different, even though the location and the subject was the same!

              Hoping that these benefits would inspire many to join the band-wagon of ‘photo-walks’!! (Like there is any ;))
              </p>
              <p>
              Happy Clicking!!
