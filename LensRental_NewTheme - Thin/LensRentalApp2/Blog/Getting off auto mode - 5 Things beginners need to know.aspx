                Once you are ready to venture out of the auto mode, and experiment with the manual settings, you need to understand the three aspects, which relate to light.
                There are three elements of the exposure triangle – ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed.

                Understanding Depth of Field can prove to be quite a hurdle for beginners, but prove to be a game changer if you know how to control it. Understanding this single concept can boost your confidence as a photographer.  What is depth of field you say? A camera can only focus its lens at a single point, but there will be an area that stretches in front of and behind this focus point that still appears sharp.
                This zone is known as the depth of field.
